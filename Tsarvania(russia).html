  <h1>Lore</h1>
  <p>Lore is the catch-all term for story, world-building, and anything in the game that is not related to Game Systems. Various aspects of lore are usually analyzed to expand upon the knowledge of the in-game universe.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Long ago, there were two mighty dragons named Glacirosa and Flametonguer. Glacirosa was an ice dragon, with scales as white as snow and the power to freeze anything in its path. Flametonguer, on the other hand, was a volcanic dragon, with scales as black as coal and the ability to spew molten lava from its mouth.

    Despite their opposing natures, Glacirosa and Flametonguer were close friends, and they roamed the earth together in search of a place to call their own. They eventually came across a large island in the middle of the ocean, untouched by any other creature. It was a barren and lifeless place, but the two dragons saw its potential.
    
    Working together, Glacirosa used its power to freeze the ocean surrounding the island, creating a thick layer of ice. Flametonguer then used its volcanic heat to melt the ice, creating a warm and fertile land for them to call home.
    
    As time passed, the dragons used their powers to shape the island to their liking. Glacirosa created towering glaciers and snow-capped mountains, while Flametonguer made deep caverns and volcanic landscapes. The island became a place of contrasts, with fire and ice existing side by side in perfect balance.
    
    But the two dragons knew that their island needed more than just themselves to thrive. So, they summoned forth a group of humans who shared their love for the land and its beauty. These people were humble and hardworking, and they soon became devoted to their dragon rulers.
    
    Glacirosa and Flametonguer taught the humans how to live in harmony with nature, and in turn, the humans taught the dragons about the joys of companionship and community. Together, they worked to build a society that was both prosperous and harmonious, with humans and dragons living side by side in peace.
    
    And so, the island country of Glacifire was born, ruled by the ice dragon and the volcanic dragon, with their loyal human subjects living in harmony with the land and the elements. The memory of Glacirosa and Flametonguer and their remarkable island lives on as a symbol of the power of nature and the importance of balance.

    <h2>Culture</h2><p>The culture of Glacifire is deeply rooted in balance and harmony, as humans and dragons work together to create a society where fire and ice coexist peacefully. The people are skilled in crafting tools and structures from ice and volcanic rock, and they hold a deep reverence for the creatures that call the island home. Their culture is also rich in storytelling and art, with myths and legends passed down through generations that often involve the dragons and their feats of bravery and magic. Overall, the society of Glacifire is one of cooperation and respect, where humans and dragons work together to honor the power and beauty of nature.</p>

    <h2>Language</h2>
<p>Frostfirean is the language spoken by the people of Glacifire, a land ruled by two dragons - Glacirosa, the ice dragon, and Flametonguer, the volcanic dragon. The language is deeply rooted in the principles of balance and harmony, reflecting the culture of the land. It is a complex language that incorporates elements of both ice and fire, with unique grammar and syntax structures. Frostfirean is also rich in storytelling and art, with myths and legends passed down through generations.</p></div>
