  <h1>Lore</h1>
  <p>Lore is the catch-all term for story, world-building, and anything in the game that is not related to Game Systems. Various aspects of lore are usually analyzed to expand upon the knowledge of the in-game universe.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Long ago, when the world was still young and full of wonder, the Air Dragon, known as Breezewyrm, took to the skies in search of a new home. She had grown tired of the constant chaos and destruction wrought by the other dragon deities, and longed for a place of peace and beauty.

    Breezewyrm flew high and far, her wings carrying her over mountain ranges and vast oceans. Finally, she came upon a small, rocky island, surrounded by clear blue waters. It was a desolate place, with no life or vegetation to speak of, but Breezewyrm saw its potential.
    
    Using her powers of wind and air, she began to shape the island, smoothing its rocky edges and carving out deep valleys and canyons. She summoned the winds and the rains, bringing life-giving moisture to the parched earth. And soon, the island began to bloom with new life.
    
    Breezewyrm summoned flocks of birds and other creatures to the island, and they soon made their homes there. She created towering cliffs and canyons, and the harpies soon arrived to make their homes there. They were swift and graceful, soaring through the skies with ease, and they became Breezewyrm's closest companions and allies.
    
    As the years passed, Breezewyrm continued to shape the island, creating towering mountains and deep valleys. She created a lush forest, filled with trees and plants of every kind, and it soon became home to a diverse array of creatures.
    
    Breezewyrm was a just and fair ruler, watching over her people with a careful eye. She protected them from harm, and they in turn worshiped her as a goddess, offering her tribute and reverence.
    
    And so, the island became known as the Land of the Harpies, a place of great beauty and wonder, where Breezewyrm had created a haven for herself and her people. It was a place of peace and harmony, where the winds and the skies reigned supreme, and Breezewyrm was hailed as the queen of the skies.</p>

    <h2>Culture</h2><p>The culture of Dragon's Isle revolves around their reverence for the Air Dragon, who created their home. They have a close relationship with nature and rely heavily on its resources, and they pass down stories of the Air Dragon through generations. The islanders worship the dragon and perform rituals to honor it, and their culture is deeply rooted in their connection to the natural world and spiritual beliefs.</p>
<hr>
    <h2>Language</h2>
<p>The language spoken by the people on the Dragon's Isle is known as "Wingtongue", named after the Air Dragon's powerful wings. Wingtongue is a language that reflects the harmony between the dragon and the humans, with words and phrases that symbolize nature, balance, and respect for all living things. It is a language with a unique sound, with long, flowing syllables that mimic the wind and the waves of the ocean. Despite being spoken by a small community, Wingtongue has a rich oral tradition, with stories and legends passed down from generation to generation, celebrating the island's unique history and culture.</p>
